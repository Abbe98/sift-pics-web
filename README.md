Sift.pics is a spin-off of Ajapaik

The code hosted here is a Django application that serves our mobile app via Django REST Framework
and implements some views to get acquainted with the project and it's results. Most of the mobile apps'
functionality has also been implemented for the web.

Our (official) instance: http://sift.pics/

The main attraction is our Android app that people use to send us data (tags) about historic photographs
so anyone could sort them based on said tags later:
